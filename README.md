## About this project

### Assignment: Web Development

### Programming anguages and tools: 
HTML, CSS, PHP. Additionally, XAMPP was used to host the application on a local web server, as well as phpMyAdmin to manage the MySQL database.

### About: 
We were assigned a scenario and databse, and were required to create a PHP web application that would demonstrate, browse functionality, create functionality, authentication and authorisation, writing maintainable code and CSS and design.

This particular application would be created around the Queensgate Airlines scenario which featured several tables including flights, crew and so on. Users can log into the application, view a list of flights dynamically generated from the database and authorised users only can create new flights. The application was built using code that was sturectured effectively using MVC principles and the CSS optimised to ensure, pages load quickly, not noisy, has a cohesive consistent design and is easy to navigate.

### How to use:
1. Login in using one of the following credentials -
- email: k.l.hutton@assign3.ac.uk password: password
- email: y.miandad@assign3.ac.uk password: letmein
- email: s.laxman@assign3.ac.uk password: password2

Different users have different roles and so will be authorised to access pages in the application.

2. Navigate the application.
